## Introduction
---------------

This script is designed to prevent AFK (Away From Keyboard) detection in Roblox by simulating keyboard input. It is easy to use and requires minimal setup.

## Setup
--------

To set up the script, simply follow these steps:

1. Run `install.bat` to install the required dependencies.
2. Run `main.py` to start the script.

That's it! You're now ready to use the script.

## Usage
-----

To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Run `main.py` and select the mode you want to use:
	* `[1] Jump Key`: This mode will simulate the space bar being pressed every second.
	* `[2] Extra`: This mode will open a menu with additional options.
2. If you select `[2] Extra`, you will be prompted to select an option:
	* `[1] Credits`: This will open a link to my Discord profile.
3. Once you've selected your mode, simply tab into Roblox and the script will start simulating keyboard input.

## Troubleshooting
----------------

If you encounter any issues with the script, try the following:

* Make sure you've run `install.bat` to install the required dependencies.
* Make sure you've selected the correct mode and options.
* If you're still having issues, try restarting the script or seeking help from the creator.
